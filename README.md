# Introduction

This project was done and submitted to the School of Computing, Engineering and Digital Technologies as part of the in course assessment(ICA) for Software for Digital Innovation by ***Chukwurah Paul Dumebi***. This GUI application was created with the help of the `Python Tkinter GUI framework` and additional helpful Python packages like pandas and numpy. The requirements.txt file contains a list of the full packages used on this project.

# Installation

This project was developed using a number of `Python packages`, all of which must be installed before the project can be used. The versions of the packages must match the ones used during the project's development because using a different version may result in unexpected behaviours. It is important to note that for this project to run smoothly, ***Python version 3 upwards*** is highly recommended.

`Steps`

1. ***Python*** :
    Visit the python official website to install python (`https://www.python.org/downloads/`). Download a python interpreter compatible with your device. For ***Mac*** the in built one is not recommended update to ***Python 3***

2. ***Packages*** :
    To install the packages used and their respective version which is located in the requirements.txt file. Open the project folder in ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)*** and type the following command `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. For ***Mac Users*** use `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

This will successfully install all python packages used in this project.


# Launch

To launch the application, open the project folder in ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)*** and type or paste this command `python -m main`. For ***Mac*** use `python3 -m main`, this will start the GUI application ![GUI Interface](img/tkinter-window.png).


# Available Visualisations

This GUI driven application helps users to process and visualize the following:

1. Covid-19 cases information from 03/2020 to 11/2020 - ![covid tab](img/covid.png)

    1. Daily and %Change in daily cases ![Daily and %Change in daily cases Interface](img/daily-and-pct-change.png).
    2. Compare two regions ![Compare two regions chart](img/compare-two-regions.png).
    3. Top region with highest cases ![Top region with highest cases chart](img/top-region-with-highest-cases.png).
    4. View cases by month ![View cases by month chart](img/view-by-month.png).

2. Stop and Search information from 01/2020 to 12/2022 - ![stop and search tab](img/stop-and-search-tab.png)

    1. View by age range ![View by age range chart](img/view-by-age-range.png)
    2. View by search purpose ![View by search purpose chart](img/view-by-search-purpose.png)
    3. View by ethnicity ![View by ethnicity chart](img/view-by-ethnicity.png)
    4. View by outcome ![View by outcome chart](img/view-by-outcome.png)
    5. View by gender ![View by gender chart](img/view-by-gender.png)


# How to run test

NB: ***All of the aforementioned packages must be installed before attempting to run tests for the application***.
In this project, the `Testing Driven Development (TDD)` approach was used. All tests are contained in the  ***test_main.py*** file.

The procedures shown below show how to execute the tests used for this project and evaluate the application's test coverage:

1. Run ***test_main.py*** file. Open the project folder in ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)*** and type `python -m test_app`. For ***Mac*** type `python3 -m test_app`, this runs all the test present in the file with the result of each test pass or fail see image ![view test](img/test.png).

2. To check for test coverage, Open the project folder in ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)***
    1.Run the tests with coverage first by entering the following command into ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)***. `python -m coverage run -m unittest discover`. For ***Mac*** use `python3 -m coverage run -m unittest discover`, this runs all the test for the GUI application and calculates the coverage ![view test](img/coverage.png).
    
    2. To report the coverage in ***Command Prompt*** or ***Terminal (Mac)*** enter the following command `python -m coverage report -m`. For ***Mac*** use `python3 -m coverage report -m`, this shows the coverage of the tests see image ![view test](img/coverage-report.png).



The report contains the full details about the Blackbox testing, both functional and non-functional. Thanks 🙏
